// C++: class Octree
/**
 * Octree for 3D vision.
 *
 * In 3D vision filed, the Octree is used to process and accelerate the pointcloud data. The class Octree represents
 * the Octree data structure. Each Octree will have a fixed depth. The depth of Octree refers to the distance from
 * the root node to the leaf node.All OctreeNodes will not exceed this depth.Increasing the depth will increase
 * the amount of calculation exponentially. And the small number of depth refers low resolution of Octree.
 * Each node contains 8 children, which are used to divide the space cube into eight parts. Each octree node represents
 * a cube. And these eight children will have a fixed order, the order is described as follows:
 *
 * For illustration, assume,
 *
 * rootNode: origin == (0, 0, 0), size == 2
 *
 * Then,
 *
 * children[0]: origin == (0, 0, 0), size == 1
 *
 * children[1]: origin == (1, 0, 0), size == 1, along X-axis next to child 0
 *
 * children[2]: origin == (0, 1, 0), size == 1, along Y-axis next to child 0
 *
 * children[3]: origin == (1, 1, 0), size == 1, in X-Y plane
 *
 * children[4]: origin == (0, 0, 1), size == 1, along Z-axis next to child 0
 *
 * children[5]: origin == (1, 0, 1), size == 1, in X-Z plane
 *
 * children[6]: origin == (0, 1, 1), size == 1, in Y-Z plane
 *
 * children[7]: origin == (1, 1, 1), size == 1, furthest from child 0
